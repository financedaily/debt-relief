			<p>It is Easy Savings's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://financedaily.github.io/debt-relief/">https://financedaily.github.io/debt-relief/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://financedaily.github.io/debt-relief/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

			<p>Like most website operators, Easy Savings collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Easy Savings's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Easy Savings's visitors use its website. From time to time, Easy Savings may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>We will not tolerate anyone copying content and styling from our website. No part of the digital product or website content may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including printing (except for your own personal use), recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without our prior written permission, except in the case of brief quotations embodied in critical reviews, and certain other noncommercial uses permitted by copyright law. For permission requests please visit the contact us page. Legal notices will be issued to ad networks, advertisers or any other parties unlawfully copying content.</p>
<p>*Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending on your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms. Not all clients are able to complete their program for various reasons, including their ability to save sufficient funds. We do not guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific period of time. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not available in all states and our fees may vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss potential tax consequences of less than full balance debt resolution. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and interest. However, negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest. C.P.D. Reg. No. T.S.12-03825.</p>
